</p><p>There is a natural way of adding
<a href="http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/math/home/programs/undergrad/CalculusQuestStudyGuides/vcalc/vector/vector.html">vectors</a> and multiplying vectors by scalars.
Is there also a way to multiply two vectors and get a useful result?
It turns out there are two; one type produces a scalar (the dot product)
while the other produces a vector (the
<a href="http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/math/home/programs/undergrad/CalculusQuestStudyGuides/vcalc/crossprod/crossprod.html">cross
product</a>). We will discuss the dot product here.
</p><p>The dot product of two vectors
<b>a</b>=&lt;a_1,a_2,a_3&gt; and
<b>b</b>=&lt;b_1,b_2,b_3&gt;
is given by
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img1.gif">
</p><p>An equivalent definition of the dot product is
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img2.gif">
</p><p>where theta is the angle between the two vectors (see the figure
below) and |<b>c</b>| denotes the magnitude of the vector <b>c</b>. This
second definition is useful for finding the angle theta between
the two vectors.
</p><p align="Center"><img src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/dotprod1.gif">
</p><p align="Center">
</p><h4>Example
</h4><p> The dot product of <b>a</b>=&lt;1,3,-2&gt; and
<b>b</b>=&lt;-2,4,-1&gt; is
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img3.gif">
</p><p>Using the (**)we see that
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img4.gif">
</p><p>which implies theta=45.6 degrees.
</p><p>An important use of the dot product is to test whether or not two vectors
are orthogonal. Two vectors are orthogonal if the angle between them
is 90 degrees. Thus, using (**) we see that the dot product of two
orthogonal vectors is zero. Conversely, the only way the dot product
can be zero is if the angle between the two vectors is 90 degrees (or trivially
if one or both of the vectors is the zero vector). Thus, two non-zero
vectors
have dot product zero if and only if they are orthogonal.
</p><p>
</p><h4>Example
</h4><p>&lt;1,-1,3&gt; and &lt;3,3,0&gt; are orthogonal since
the dot product is 1(3)+(-1)(3)+3(0)=0.
</p><p>
</p><p><b><font size="+1"><a name="Projection">Projections</a></font></b>
</p><p>One important use of dot products is in projections. The scalar
projection of <b>b</b> onto <b>a</b> is the <i>length</i> of the segment
AB shown
in
the figure below. The vector projection of <b>b</b> onto
<b>a</b> is the <i>vector</i> with this length that begins at the point A
points
in the same direction
(or opposite direction if the scalar projection is negative) as <b>a</b>.
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/dotprod2.gif">
</p><p>Thus, mathematically, the scalar projection of <b>b</b> onto <b>a</b>
is |<b>b</b>|cos(theta) (where theta is the angle between <b>a</b> and
<b>b</b>) which from (*) is given by
</p><p align="Center"><img src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img5.gif" width="116" height="46">
</p><p>This quantity is also called the component of <b>b</b> in the <b>a</b>
direction (hence the notation comp). And, the vector projection is merely
the unit vector
<b>a</b>/|<b>a</b>| times the scalar projection of <b>b</b> onto <b>a</b>:
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img6.gif" width="198" height="49">
</p><p>Thus, the scalar projection of <b>b</b> onto <b>a</b> is the magnitude
of the vector projection of <b>b</b> onto <b>a</b>.
</p><p align="Left">
</p><h4><p align="Left">Example
</p></h4><p align="Left">Suppose you wish to find the work W done in
moving a particle
from one point to another. From physics we know W=Fd where F is the magnitude
of the force moving the particle and d is the distance between the two points.
However, this relation is only valid when the force acts in the direction
the particle moves. Suppose this is not the case. Let the force
vector be <b>F</b>=&lt;2,3,4&gt; and the displacement vector be
<b>d</b>=&lt;1,2,3&gt;. In this case, the work is the product of the
distance moved (the magnitude of the displacement vector) and the magnitude
of the component of the force that acts in the direction of displacement
(the scalar projection of <b>F</b> onto <b>d</b>):
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img7.gif">
</p><p align="Left">Thus, the work done by the force to displace the particle from
say the origin to the point (1,2,3) is
</p><p align="Center"><img align="Middle" src="./Dot Products and Projections_files/img8.gif">
</p><p align="Left">Note that this is the easiest way to compute the dot product
since the angle between the vectors <b>F</b> and <b>d</b> is unknown.
